			<h1> Sample Poem </h1>
			<h2> No Class, More Stress  </h2>

			<p><span class="bold">Why</span> won't students come to labs? This is something I always ponder. After unprepared students write exams, They watch their marks in wonder. </p>

			<p><span class="bold">Why</span> won't students come to labs? What is more important than class? How can you be a student if you don't even try to pass?</p>	
				
			<p><span class="bold">Why</span> won't students come to labs? It happens all the time. If you came to labs, you'd know what to do. But you would rather duck and go lime.</p>	
				
			<p><span class="bold">Why</span> won't students come to labs? I see them all now stressing. If you only learned this basic programming, You would surely now be zessing.</p>
